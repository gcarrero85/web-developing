<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>My name is Gabriel Carrero.  I am Web Developer living in Conroe, Texas.  Although I'm relatively new to the industry, 
  I feel like I'm taking a shine to it.  In this website you will find 2 of my first projects that I have completed with the guidance
  of Amanda Yu's complete web developer course.  While still basic, I am hoping to learn as much as I can and become a valuable player
  in this amazing industry.

<p>My primary background is in music.  I have played guitar for over thirty years and have no plans of stopping any time soon.  I have a beautiful wife and five fur babies (Two dogs and three cats)</p>

<p>Since I have started to learn to code I have found myself becoming more and more excited about it.  I come up with ideas and ponder how to code them.  
  It has really been a lot of fun learning to this new skill.  It feels very much like learning a new language and I am thoroughly enjoying it.
